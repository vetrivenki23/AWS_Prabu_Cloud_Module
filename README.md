`# Terraform Module: AWS EC2 Instance  This Terraform module allows you to create an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance with specific configurations.  ## Usage  You can use this module by including it in your Terraform configuration file as follows:  ```hcl module "techlearnings_aws_ec2" {   source = "app.terraform.io/your-organization/aws-ec2-instance/aws"   version = "1.0.0"    ami           = var.ec2_ami           # Replace with your desired AMI ID   instance_type = var.ec2_type          # Replace with your desired instance type   user_data     = file("userdata.sh")   # Provide a path to your user data script    tags = {     Name = "TechLearnings-EC2"  # Customize the tag values as needed   } }`

In this block, you should specify the desired `ami`, `instance_type`, `user_data`, and any additional tags according to your requirements. Make sure that the `source` and `version` values match your module's location and version.
